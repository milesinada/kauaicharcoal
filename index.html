		<p>Making use of the invasive species of Kauai, the Kauai Charcoal Company creates high quality charcoal for your next cook out, bonfire, smokers, and even those truck bed hibachi's. We use the wood from the invasive Albizia tree and by products from local coffee shops to create a charcoal that is both high quality and environmentally friendly.</p>
